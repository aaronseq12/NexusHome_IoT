NexusHome: IoT Smart Home Dashboard & Automation PlatformNexusHome is a modern IoT platform built with C# and ASP.NET Core. It provides a real-time web dashboard to monitor and control simulated smart home devices and features a powerful, user-configurable automation rules engine.‚ú® Core FeaturesLive Dashboard: A dynamic web interface built with Blazor that displays real-time telemetry from all connected devices.Device Simulation: A flexible console application that realistically simulates various IoT devices like thermostats, lights, and motion sensors.Custom Automation Engine: Create powerful "if-this-then-that" style rules to automate your smart home (e.g., "If motion is detected after 10 PM, turn on the hallway light").Real-time Communication: Leverages SignalR to instantly push data from the server to the web dashboard without needing to refresh.Scalable Architecture: Built with a clean, service-oriented architecture that is easy to maintain and extend.üõ†Ô∏è Technology StackThe platform is built using a modern, robust set of technologies from the .NET ecosystem.ComponentTechnologyPurposeBackend APIASP.NET Core 8 Web APIData ingestion, device control, rules APIFrontend Web AppBlazor WebAssemblyInteractive and responsive user interfaceDatabasePostgreSQLRelational data storage for devices and rulesData AccessEntity Framework Core 8Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)Real-time EngineSignalRBi-directional client-server communicationDevice Simulator.NET 8 Console ApplicationSimulates IoT device telemetryüöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.Prerequisites.NET 8 SDKDocker Desktop (Recommended for database)A C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio 2022, JetBrains Rider, or VS Code with C# Dev Kit)1. Set Up the PostgreSQL DatabaseThe easiest way to run PostgreSQL is with Docker. Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root of your project with the following content:version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres_db:
    image: postgres:14
    container_name: nexushome_db
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=nexushome
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yoursecurepassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=nexushome_dev
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:
Open a terminal in your project's root directory and run docker-compose up -d to start the database server.2. Configure and Run the APINavigate to the NexusHome.Api directory.Open appsettings.json and ensure the DefaultConnection string matches the database settings from your docker-compose.yml file.Apply the database migrations by running the following command in the NexusHome.Api directory:dotnet ef database update
Start the API:dotnet run
Note the URL the API is running on (e.g., https://localhost:7123).3. Run the ApplicationsYou will need to run three applications simultaneously in separate terminals.API: (Already running from the previous step).Device Simulator:Open a new terminal and navigate to NexusHome.DeviceSimulator.In Program.cs, update the ApiBaseUrl constant to match your API's URL.Run dotnet run.Web App:Open a third terminal and navigate to NexusHome.WebApp.In Pages/Index.razor and Pages/Rules.razor, update the ApiBaseUrl constant to match your API's URL.Run dotnet run.Open your web browser and navigate to the Blazor app's URL (e.g., https://localhost:7289).You should now see the dashboard with live data streaming from the simulator!
